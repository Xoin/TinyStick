# TinyStick
This tiny project exists as a collection of things I frequently need when doing
my reverse engeneering projects. For the more expenreinced users around this
subject I recommend finding something better than this. I generally don't care
much about rules and conventions and aim for what I find best to use and easy to
understand. Sure you can do better with some magic [censored to not hurt peels
 feels] and like to share it but
I'm probably going to learn nothing about how it works or why.

It also has loads of comment formats so that documenting what you do should be
pretty easy and should not require leaving your text editor. It's pretty verbose
and something you will probably hate from the start.

## Things that might intrest you
Some stuff here I probably love to brag about.

## Why the files are what they are
### Main.c
This will be the file where you do your funky stuff and probably will rename
before even starting, it contains some stuff to get you up and running but other
[censored to not hurt peels feels] is things you need to do.

### Adresses.h
The place where you will keep all addresses neatly.

### TinyStick.c
Most of the functions that are usefull.

### TinyStick.h
Some other stuff.

## Prerequists
## Compiling
